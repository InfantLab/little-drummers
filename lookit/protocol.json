            "purpose": "Whilst tapping along to our favourite song may seem automatic to us as adults, it is actually a pretty complex behaviour. We know that young children are brilliant at ‘sensing’ the rhythm of music but that they take some time to be able to coordinate their movement to it. We would like to know if the developing skill of toddlers to move in time with the beat of music is related to their general ability to monitor and adapt to the environment around them.",
            "procedures": "We ask that your child is sat in a chair or highchair, within easy reach of a table. Your child will see some videos of a hand drumming (some fast, some slow) and will be asked to drum along on the table in front of them. There are no anticipated risks associated with participating.",
            "datause": "We are interested in your child's ability to match the rhythms that they hear. We will use specialist software to measure the timing of your child’s movements. We will look at these data in light of your survey responses.",
            "payment": "Payment for participation through vouchers is not considered a benefit, it is compensation for participation. Within 14 days after participating in this study, we will email you a $5 Amazon gift card which you can exchange for credit at Amazon. To be eligible for the gift card, your child must be in the age range for this study, you need to submit a valid consent statement, and we need to see that there is a child with you. But we will send a gift card even if you do not finish the whole study or if we are not able to use your child&#39;s data.  \n\n We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. You will not receive results of the procedures and tasks your child performs as part of this research. Our conclusions are about how groups of children respond, and therefore individual results are not meaningful. However, possible benefits include learning more about research with children.",
            "Publication of results": "The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. Raw data (for instance, the tempo of children's table hits) may be published when it cannot identify children. We never publish children's birthdates or names, and we never publish your demographic data in conjunction with your child's video.",
