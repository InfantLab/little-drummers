_Version - Not even alpha!_

This repository holds code, data and documentation for a study of rhythm perception and generation in toddlers. We ask 2 to 2.5 year olds to bang on a table either with or without an accompanying tempo video. Experiment takes place in parents own home and is recorded on their laptop using the [MIT LookIT](https://lookit.mit.edu) platform. 



This directory has several subfolders
* `lookit` -  This folder contains files to run a web based study of rhythm perception in toddlers. The experiment runs on the [MIT LookIT](https://lookit.mit.edu) platform. To find out more about using this in your own research visit the [LookIT documentation](https://lookit.readthedocs.io/en/develop/)
* `docs` - Supporting documentation such as ethics forms, data sharing agreements (including GDPR) 
* `data` - Anonymised movement data from the study
* `analysis` - A set of jupyter(python) notebooks that are used to convert video into movement data, then collate and analyse the data.

### About the analysis
The analysis was performed using the [VASC toolkit](https://github.com/InfantLab/VASC), developed by Caspar. It is a freely downloadable, open source project for extracting human movement from videos and analysing rhythm, synchrony and causality. A tutorial can be found at the project homepage. 

_This study has recieved ethical approval from the Ethics Committee in the Psychology Department of Goldsmiths, University of London, September 2020._
