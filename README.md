This repository holds code, data and documentation for a study of rhythm perception and generation in toddlers. We ask 1-2 year olds to bang on a table either with or without an accompanying tempo video. Experiment takes place in parents own home and is recorded on their laptop using the [MIT LookIT](https://lookit.mit.edu) platform.
